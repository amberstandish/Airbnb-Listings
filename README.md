# Airbnb-Listings
This repository contains a notebook that I have created to analyse London AirBnB listing data. 
The underlying data is from InsideAirbnb and can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The source for the map of London's boroughs can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation
This code uses the following libraries:
> pandas \n
> numpy
> plotly
> matplotlib
> geopandas

This code should run without issues with Python 3.7.10 in Google Colaboratory.

## <a name="motivation"></a> Project Motivation
This notebook has been created to better understand the London Airbnb rental market, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Using Python, I have investigated three questions for the period June 2020 to April 2021:

1. How many listings have left and joined the platform?
2. Did the proportion of properties leaving and joining vary by property type?
3. Did the net change in the number of listings vary by borough?

## <a name="files"></a> File Descriptions
Apart from the README file, there is only one notebook in this repository. It contains the code to I used to generate all outputs used in my analysis.

## <a name="results"></a> Results
I have written a blog post discussing my findings [here](https://medium.com/@astandish19).
